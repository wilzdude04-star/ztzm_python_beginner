# Step 1: Create a set of visited cities

visited_cities = {"New York", "London", "Tokyo", "Paris", "Sydney"}



# Step 2: Try adding a duplicate city

# Step 3: Add a new city

visited_cities.add("Berlin")



# Step 4: Remove an existing city

visited_cities.discard("Sydney")



# Step 5: Print all visited cities
